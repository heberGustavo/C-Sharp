### Connection String

You must access the file which is located at: 0-Portal -> appsettings.json -> CONNECTION_STRING and CONNECTION_STRING_DEBUG

As this system was developed to run localhost, it is necessary to create a Database with the name "ProjetoTeste".

It is necessary to execute the scripts located in: MIGRATION > Scripts.

Note: It is extremely important to execute the scripts in order, otherwise there will be errors in the database.

Note: It may be necessary to adjust the script configuration
